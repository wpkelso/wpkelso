Hi, I'm William (_he/him/they_)

I'm a computer engineering student with a heavy focus in embedded systems development and programming.
In addition to my interests in the art of the code-monkey, I greatly enjoy designing things that force me to rethink how I approach a situation, whether that be an icon, a t-shirt, or a robot.

Currently I am the electrical team lead at [AquaPack Robotics](https://aquapackrobotics.org), a student organization at North Carolina State University.
There, I've been focused on high-level system design for autonomous underwater vehicles, in particular the SeaWolf VIII and SeaWolf IX systems.
