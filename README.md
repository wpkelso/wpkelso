Hi, I&rsquo;m William (_he/him_)

I enjoy software programming, UI/UX design, and making the world easier to live in. I also contribute to elementary OS.

I'm currently exploring and learning about:
- Rust
- Vala/GTK
- Iconography

## Current Projects
- [expandtheon](https://github.com/ellie-commons/expandtheon), a project to extend the elementary OS icon set to cover common third-party applications
- [slate](https://github.com/wpkelso/slate), a "dumb as rocks" text editor for elementary OS
- [lc3sim](https://github.com/wpkelso/lc3sim), a simulator core for the LC3 micro-architecture, written in Rust
