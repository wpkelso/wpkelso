Hi, I'm William (_he/him/they_)

I enjoy firmware, UI/UX design, and making the world easier to use. I also contribute to elementary OS.


I am the current electrical team lead at [AquaPack Robotics](https://aquapackrobotics.org), a student organization at North Carolina State University.
There, I've been focused on high-level system design for autonomous underwater vehicles, in particular the SeaWolf VIII and SeaWolf IX systems.
Most all work for the club has been done in club repos.

Currently looking for full-time opportunites as a fresh Computer Engineering grad.
