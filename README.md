Hi, I&rsquo;m William (_he/him/they_)

I enjoy software &mdash; particularly low-level, UI/UX design, and making the world easier to live in. I also contribute to elementary OS.

I'm currently exploring and learning about:
- Local-first software
- Rust
- UI prototyping
- Iconography

## Current Projects
- [Appcons](https://github.com/wpkelso/appcons), a project to extend the elementary OS icon set to cover common third-party applications
- [icons](https://github.com/elementary/icons), a system icon set for elementary OS
